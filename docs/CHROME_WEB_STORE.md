# Chrome Web Store Submission Notes

This document contains reviewer-facing explanations for the current Beeyond Limits package. Keep it synchronized with `manifest.json`, extension behavior, and the Chrome Web Store privacy fields.

## Single purpose

Beeyond Limits helps users maintain focused work sessions by combining a timer, task planning, user-configured distraction blocking, session tracking, and ambient audio in one local-first workflow.

All features support that focus-workflow purpose. The extension does not inject content into arbitrary pages, replace search, display advertising, or collect browsing data for unrelated purposes.

## Permission justifications

### `storage`

Stores tasks, timer state, user-created session templates, active-session recovery data, session history, blocked-domain lists, ambient-audio settings, and preferences locally. This allows a running timer and configured workflow to survive popup closure and browser restart.

### `alarms`

Schedules Pomodoro and Focus Session phase completion in the background. The popup is not persistent, so a Chrome alarm is needed to complete a user-started timer reliably after the popup closes.

### `declarativeNetRequest`

Creates and removes dynamic rules for domains the user explicitly adds to the standalone blocker or the blocker attached to a Focus Session. Rules only target `main_frame` navigation and redirect matching domains to the packaged `blocked.html` page. The API is used instead of intercepting request content.

### `notifications`

Shows timer-completion notifications for user-started Pomodoro and Focus Session phases. Notifications are not used for advertising, donation requests, or unsolicited promotion.

### `offscreen`

Creates a packaged offscreen document for ambient audio and timer-alarm playback. Manifest V3 service workers do not provide a persistent DOM media context, so the offscreen document is required to play user-selected audio while the popup is closed.

### `<all_urls>` host access

The blocker accepts any HTTP or HTTPS domain chosen by the user. Broad host access is required so dynamic `declarativeNetRequest` redirect rules can operate on those user-selected domains, including while the extension popup is closed.

The permission is used only for top-level blocking redirects. Beeyond Limits does not register content scripts, inject code into pages, read page content, access cookies, inspect request or response bodies, or collect a general browsing history. Only the user-created blocked-domain list is stored, and it remains in `chrome.storage.local`.

### Web-accessible `blocked.html`

Only `blocked.html` is exposed to HTTP and HTTPS pages because Chrome must be able to redirect a blocked top-level navigation to this packaged page. No scripts, storage files, audio files, or internal application bundles are exposed through `web_accessible_resources`.

## Remote code declaration

Select: **No, this extension does not use remote code.**

All executable JavaScript, CSS, fonts, quotes, icons, and audio are packaged with the extension. The build does not use remote scripts, `eval`, or downloaded executable logic.

## Data-use summary

The extension handles user-created tasks, goals, session state/history, preferences, and blocked domains locally. It does not transmit this information to the developer or third parties and does not use it for advertising, analytics, credit decisions, or sale. See `PRIVACY.md` for the full disclosure.

## Reviewer test instructions

1. Open the extension popup and create a task.
2. Start, pause, resume, and reset the Pomodoro timer.
3. Add a domain in Website Blocker, enable blocking, and navigate to that domain; Chrome should redirect the top-level page to `blocked.html`.
4. Disable blocking and confirm the site is reachable again.
5. Configure a Focus Session with a timer, optional task, ambient sound, and blocked domain.
6. Start the session, close and reopen the popup, and confirm state recovery.
7. Test ambient audio and the timer-completion alarm, including mute/stop controls.

No account, credentials, payment, or external service is required for review.
